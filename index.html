  <h1 class="title-projects projectCommerce">Project 2 - E-commerce</h1>
  <p class="project-one-described">The e-commerce website, also called an online store, is a virtual platform that allows businesses to sell products and services directly to consumers over the internet. It acts like a digital storefront, replacing the need for a physical brick-and-mortar location. <br><br>

    This e-commerce website can sell physical goods (selling shoes). Some e-commerce websites can provide selling digital products (ebooks, software, music), or even services (consultations, online courses).
    Each product has a detailed description, image, and pricing.
    E-commerce website offers customer service options like email support, and social media connection. <br><br>
    
    E-commerce websites have become a major part of the retail landscape, and their popularity continues to grow as online shopping becomes increasingly convenient and secure. <br><br>
    Overall, this code provides a starting point for a basic e-commerce website. It uses classes likely defined in a separate stylesheet (main.css) to style the layout and appearance of the elements.

The HTML structure includes elements like &ltheader&gt for navigation, &ltmain&gt for the main content, and &ltfooter&gt for footer links and social media icons.
        The main content area features a grid layout displaying individual products with images, descriptions, prices, and a "Buy" button.
        I applied responsive design techniques using CSS media queries to adjust the layout and grid columns for different screen sizes. For example, on smaller screens, the products grid switches to two columns, and on even smaller screens, it adapts to a single column layout for better readability and user experience.
        In the &ltfooter&gt, I organized footer links into different sections and included social media icons with links for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
        Overall, this code snippet showcases my skills in HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling and responsive design, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website for a trail running product collection.

        <p class="grid-area-descript">I developed an HTML and CSS code for a website called "The Flavourist" focusing on recipes and culinary content. In the HTML section, I included elements such as &ltheader&gt, &ltmain&gt, and &ltfooter&gt to structure the page.
          The &lthead&gt section contains meta tags for character set and viewport settings, along with links to external CSS file for styling. I also included Bootstrap CSS via a CDN link for additional styling and responsiveness.
          In the &ltheader&gt section, I created a navigation bar with Bootstrap classes for responsiveness. The navigation includes links for different meal categories like Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Salads, etc. There's also a search form and login/signup buttons aligned to the right.
          The &ltmain&gt section features a hero section with a background image and a welcoming message. It also includes two prominent buttons styled using Bootstrap classes.
          Further down in the main content area, I used a card-based layout to showcase recipe cards. Each card includes an image, recipe name, description, a "Recipe" button, and additional details like serving size, difficulty, and cooking time.
          In the CSS section, I applied custom styles for elements like header lists, hero section, recipe buttons, and footer. For instance, I set a specific font family for the header lists, styled the hero section's background image, and customized the recipe buttons' appearance.
          Overall, this code snippet demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website focused on culinary content and recipes.

            The &lthead&gt section includes meta tags for character set and viewport settings, along with links to the main CSS file for styling. I also added a custom favicon for the website.
            The &ltheader&gt features a navigation bar within a hero section, showcasing a mountain cabin logo and navigation links such as "About Us," "Cabin Location," "Services," and "Book Now." Below the navigation, there's a call-to-action (CTA) section with a welcoming message and a prominent "Plan Now" button styled for attention.
            Moving to the &ltmain&gt section, it begins with a motivational quote styled elegantly. Below that, there's a main content area with two posts displayed side by side. Each post includes an image, a title, and a "Plan Now" button, maintaining a consistent design and user flow.
            The CSS section defines styles for various elements throughout the page. I used a custom font called "font-alata" for text elements, ensuring a cohesive visual identity. The header utilizes a background image for a captivating hero section, while the navigation and CTA section are styled for readability and user interaction.

            <p class="grid-area-descript">I developed an HTML and CSS code for a website called "Apartment Therapy". 
              First, I've set up the basic structure of the HTML document with the necessary meta tags, title, favicon, and linking the CSS file. Inside the body, I've created a header section with a navigation bar containing links and a logo. There's also a mobile menu with a burger icon and a close icon, along with an overlay for the mobile menu.
              Below the header, there's a main section with various content. It includes a top section with a decorative line, a main post section with images and titles, an about section describing Apartment Therapy, and a main content section with filters and product listings.
              The filters section has different categories like Cleaning, Decoration, Cooking Tools, and Home Essentials, each with checkboxes. The main content also includes product listings with images, descriptions, prices, and a buy button for each product.
              Finally, there's a footer section with links to different categories, privacy policy, and social media icons.
              Moving on to the CSS code, I've defined fonts using @font-face and created mixins for common styles like flexbox properties and button styles. The CSS also includes media queries for responsive design, ensuring the layout adjusts well on different devices.
              I've used variables for colors and font families to maintain consistency throughout the design. The CSS also includes styles for the header, main content, filters, products, and footer sections, making sure everything looks cohesive and visually appealing.
              In the JavaScript code, I've added functionality for opening and closing the mobile menu, and a function to change the header background color based on scroll position.
              Overall, this code creates a stylish and functional website for Apartment Therapy, showcasing products and providing a pleasant user experience across devices.
